# PLEASE READ BELOW
If you are reading this I am so happy that I caught your attention. If anybody can understand what I am doing I would really love it if the could write an equivalent of my AiChess.py so that my runChess.py can host a game which I can run different people's AIs against. I would really love it and it would be so helpful to me if anybody who is interested would tell me.

Open an issue if you want to help. And attach code when you have it.
